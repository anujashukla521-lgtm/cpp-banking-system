# Bank Management System in C++

This is a beginner-friendly console-based Bank Management System project written in C++. It is designed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, file handling, and menu-driven programming.

## Features

- Account login using Account Number and PIN  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Check account balance  
- Save and load account data using files  
- Menu-driven user interface  

## Concepts Used

- Classes and Objects  
- Member functions  
- Access specifiers (public/private)  
- Constructors  
- File Handling (fstream)  
- Loops and switch-case  
- Input/Output in C++  
- Basic validation logic  

## Technologies Used

- C++  
- Standard Libraries (iostream, fstream)  

##  Project Versions
# Version 1 (Current)

- Single account management
- Login authentication using account number and PIN
- Basic banking operations (deposit, withdraw, balance check)
- File handling for persistent data storage
- Console-based interface

# Version 2 (Planned Improvements)

- Multiple account support using arrays or vectors
- Transaction history storage
- Better input validation and error handling
- Limited login attempts for security
- PIN encryption
- Advanced OOP design (inheritance and polymorphism)
- GUI version using C++ graphics or Qt

### 1. Compile the program
```bash
g++ main.cpp account.cpp -o bank
./bank
